It draws in modern metal influences, still has the post-rock elements and puts their songwriting skills on a whole new level. It reminds me of a mix of Karnivool, Oceansize with hypnotic ISIS-like post-rock passages.

I saw them live last year before they dropped Bodies and I cannot wait for more releases to come. While I still prefer Heroine over Bodies, this album has an amazing flow from start to finish, great blend of dynamics and the sound...... THE SOUND. I got new headphones this year and this album gave me instant eargasms with this new sound.

It makes me a little sad and nostalgic not having discovered them in their prime phase of the early 2000s, but I am glad I discovered them when I did. This album is a perfect example of why they are one of my favorite bands of all time. It references all their previous work and style, bring back the old school elements of The Alchemy Index, Vheissu and tie into completing the Horizons saga. West is the sunset and it definitely feels like the darker album of the two. It also made me appreciate East much more after relistening both of the albums back to back.

A special shoutout goes to Holding on which lyrically feels like a continuation of The Long Defeat and just hits on all levels easily making it one of my favorite songs of the year. The Dark Glow has just one of the best songwriting of this year and takes the dark atmosphere on a whole new level.
